    "# Components in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Common nlp libraries\n",
    "- Nltk library\n",
    "- Spacy library\n",
    "- TextBlob library\n",
    "- Gensim framework\n",
    "- Pattern framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Components in NLP\n",
    "- There are mainly five components in NLP\n",
    "  - Lexical Anlysis\n",
    "  - Syntactic Analysis\n",
    "  - Semantic Anlysis\n",
    "  - Discouse Analysis\n",
    "  - Pragmatic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Lexical Anlysis\n",
    "- Lexical means relating to the words or vocabulary of a language\n",
    "- With lexical analysis we divide a whole chunk of text into\n",
    "  - Paragraphs\n",
    "  - Sentences\n",
    "  - Words\n",
    "- It involues identifying and analysing words 'struncture'\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Syntactic Analysis\n",
    "- Syntactic means according to the syntax\n",
    "- In syntactic analysis it is the process of analysing the words in sentence\n",
    "- Analysing the grammar and arranging the words in a manner that shows the relationship among the words\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - The sentence \"The shop goes to the house\" does not pass means invaild\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.3 Semantic Analysis\n",
    "- Syntactic means relating to meaning in language\n",
    "- Semantic analysis draws the exact meaning for the words and it analyses the text to get meaningful\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - The sentences such as \"hot ice-cream\" do not pass or invalid\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.4 Discourse Analysis \n",
    "- Discourse means written or spoken communication\n",
    "- It considers the meaning of the sentance before it ends\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - The sentences such as \"He works at Google\" in this sentence \"he\" should be first word in sentence\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2.5 Pragmatic Analysis\n",
    "- Pragmatic means practical, especially when making decisions\n",
    "- Pragmatic analysis deals with overall communication and interpretation of language\n",
    "- It deals with deriving meaning use of language in various situatuion\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Use case\n",
    "- Process the below textual infomation\n",
